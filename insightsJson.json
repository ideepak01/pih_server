This KPI is crucial for the business as it directly impacts the security and reliability of operations.</li>\n<li>With an Actual value of <strong>2.63</strong> and a Plan value of <strong>2.65</strong> for March 2024, the performance is slightly below plan, indicating a minor shortfall in achieving the desired cybersecurity maturity level.</li>\n<li>The current monthly performance suggests stability, with a <strong>0.0%</strong> change in both Actual and Plan values from the previous month, and a Variance of <strong>-0.8%</strong>, signaling a consistent but slightly underperforming trend in cybersecurity maturity.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2><strong>Performance Trends</strong></h2>\n<h3><strong>Monthly Trend Analysis</strong></h3>\n<ul>\n<li>March 2024 showed consistent performance compared to February 2024, with no change in Actual values, indicating a stable cybersecurity maturity level. However, the slight deviation from the plan persists, suggesting ongoing efforts are needed to fully meet the targeted maturity level.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><strong>Quarterly Trend Analysis</strong></h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Since we are in the first quarter of 2024, the analysis focuses on the absolute performance vs. plan without quarter-over-quarter comparison. The Q1 2024 performance, with an Actual value of <strong>2.63</strong> and a Plan value of <strong>2.65</strong>, indicates a minor underperformance in achieving the desired cybersecurity maturity level, highlighting the need for continued improvement to meet the planned targets.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2><strong>Organizational Impact on Group OT Cybersecurity Maturity Performance for T&amp;I : Technology &amp; Innovation</strong></h2>\n<h3><strong>Sub-Organization Contributions</strong></h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Information Security Dept contributed <strong>100.00%</strong> to T&amp;I's performance, with an actual value of <strong>2.63</strong>, indicating a strong alignment with the overall organization's cybersecurity maturity goals.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><strong>Comparision with Other Business Lines</strong></h3>\n<ul>\n<li>T&amp;I's performance reflects a steady state of cybersecurity maturity, characterized by a high degree of operational stability and control, albeit with a slight underperformance against planned targets.</li>\n<li>The organization's ability to maintain a consistent level of cybersecurity maturity is noteworthy, given the potential complexities and challenges associated with managing operational technology (OT) systems.</li>\n<li>However, the slight underperformance suggests that T&amp;I may need to focus on optimizing its cybersecurity practices and processes to achieve higher levels of maturity and better align with its planned objectives.</li>\n</ul>",
